At the current state of the project ("very early beginning") I am seeking for some help:

* I need as many Set Analysis statements to prove parser
	* Commit them to `test/expressions.txt` or create an issue
* Help to write the parser
* Finally I'd like to create a web-page where you paste in an existing Set Analysis statement and you would just get the semantic description returned.
